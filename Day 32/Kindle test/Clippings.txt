The benefits of viewing ourselves through the lens of a growth mindset should be obvious. It liberates us from the demands of perfection. It invites us to be vulnerable and extend beyond our comfort zone. It encourages a kind of flexibility that allows us to roll with the tides of change and to innovate through difficult circumstances and encourages us to look for ways—even small ones—to expand our understanding and integrate new learnings from success or failure into our insights and strategies for the future.

“priority interrupt time” (PIT). We’ve used this to great effect in our workplace, where, at any time, anyone can pop their head into my office and ask if I’m interruptible. If I’m in the middle of something that truly can’t wait, then I ask for a few minutes until I can break. Once I’m ready, though, I focus my attention wholly on what they’re bringing to the table.

Reasoned Believers Follow the lead of the Vanguards, but are proactively engaged in building the organization after scrutinizing leaders. Pessimists Wondering if their contribution to the organization matters. Have lost faith in the plan and their role in it. Apathetic Have stopped worrying if their contributions matter to the organization. They continue to work, but only for the benefit of others. Entrenched ‘Unconscientious objectors’ who do the absolute minimum and seek to maintain the status quo while flying under the radar. Insurgents Work undercover to pull the rug out and cause a failure of any organizational plan. Vigilant, sophisticated, and invisible to the organization.

It is relatively easy to lead homogenous groups. It can be accomplished with basic technical and executive-skill competence because similar people respond to similar solutions. And this is true regardless of the nature of their similarities.

Or could you separate it further?  Have you shown the connections and relationships between these chunks? For example, have you illustrated the hierarchy between them?  Are you being as clear and simple as possible?  Does your map actually go somewhere specific, i.e. do you have a fixed endpoint in mind?  Can you see how each of the subunits relates to this end point?  Are there any gaps in the plan, in other words, have you made any assumptions about what your student already knows?

Takeaways Excellent teachers know how to “see the landscape” ahead of them, and their understanding of the field of learning allows them to set goals and parameters, prioritize and frame tasks, and gauge their students’ current understanding.  Concept maps are simplified models of more complex material that make clear the connections between different ideas. Concept maps can be drawn by both student and teacher to gauge knowledge gaps, plan lessons, learn those lessons, and assess the effectiveness of that learning.  Concept maps consist of simplified chunks or pieces of information arranged to highlight the relationships or connections between them. A good concept map is relevant, simple, accurate and draws on existing mental models and knowledge.  Once you’ve identified what your student already knows, the next step is planning how to utilize that. In some cases, this will be easy in that you only need to teach them certain concepts that will help them understand the topic you wanted to teach them in the first place. However, you could also combine the usage of concept-based maps with an inquiry-based approach and problematize what students already know in order to make them curious and eager to learn more.  The Feynman technique is a “bigger picture” technique that allows both teacher and student to identify their own mental blind spots. First, identify the concept in question, then write down an explanation of it in plain English, then identify any areas where the explanation fails or where data is missing. Then, use the power of analogy to fill in the gaps, i.e. use pre-existing mental models to better understand new material.  Analogies can aid learning because they connect old knowledge with new. Analogies can be Antonyms, Types, or Characteristics, each expressing the qualities of a new concept in terms of already understood concepts. Analogies are best when as many are used as possible, and they encourage higher-order abstract thinking.

Whenever you’re learning something new, you might, for example, highlight the text in the book so you can summarize it (remembering) and then paraphrase that text in your own words (understanding). You can then apply your understanding by constructing your own chart or diagram (applying) and taking some time to break that diagram down, question it, and link it to other diagrams you’ve already made (analyzing). You can ask yourself after all this whether these methods are actually helping you retain the material (evaluating) and use your assessment to guide the further development of improved systems of learning (creating).

Takeaways There are a range of practical methods to help on the learning journey. The SQ3R method is a way to shape the learning process, via Survey (gain an overview of the material), Question (develop deeper understanding by asking questions to direct your learning), Read (active, careful intake of the material or information), Recite (drill what has been learnt to organize and cement it in your mind) and Review (assess your progress as compared to the start, and according to your overall goals).  Bloom’s taxonomy explains that mastery is cumulative, and proceeds through levels of deepening understanding. These are Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, and Create. Each of these levels of engagement depends on mastery of the previous level. As a teacher, you can shape progressive challenge by bearing these stages in mind.  Spaced repetition or distributed practice is a way to strengthen memory and recall. The idea is to recite or review material at frequent intervals spaced over as long a period as possible, rather than “cramming” all at once, which is less effective. The key is consistency and spaced-out practice, which allows students to practice recall itself.  The Cornell Method of note-taking teaches your student to take natural notes, but then later distill key themes and points from those notes and then summarize their main findings, essentially generating a concept map of the material. This improves not only retention but depth understanding.  Finally, purposeful annotation is something done during reading, but in reality occurs before, during and after reading. Reading should be active and directed; you need to know beforehand why you are reading and what you intend to do with the information after you’ve read. This knowledge primes and focuses reading, and makes it easier to choose annotation methods (highlighting, notes, symbols

The Socratic method is another depth approach that rests on strategic inquiry. Questions can be used to unearth assumptions and bias, to probe for richer understanding, to flesh out perspectives, explore consequences and implications, examine an argument’s deeper rationale, or even look more closely at the question itself.

got them to reveal what they think, probe them further by either asking for clarifications, elaborating on something they glossed over, or problematizing something they said. These tactics force students to learn and understand new concepts by having gaps in their knowledge exposed.  Critical thinking is a great approach for more advanced concepts, as it encourages meta-cognition about both the quality of one’s thoughts and the material and learning process itself. Critical thinking is characterized by an attitude of open-mindedness, and a tolerance for ambiguity or uncertainty that takes nothing for granted. Often, it involves following an inquiry-based approach wherein you’re continuously asking your students questions that challenge their beliefs in ways that stimulate discussion and learning.  Other advanced techniques can use group work to aid learning (for example student-teacher tasks, “pair and share,” debate or student observation) or relevant visual materials (such as relationship maps, flowcharts, Venn diagrams or storyboards).  All these more advanced techniques require the student to be proactive in their learning, and they allow the teacher to not only gauge understanding but offer useful feedback.

Students will only learn when they are motivated, so it’s a teacher’s duty to establish a learning environment that supports this motivation.  Humans take action according to their appraisal of the level of effort required, its likely outcome, and the perceived desirability of that outcome. Teachers can motivate students by increasing the perceived value of the learning goal and its process, as well as boosting expectation of a positive outcome without undermining intrinsic motivation.  Gamification is an approach where gaming elements are brought into non-gaming contexts, like learning. Teachers can use “level-up” scaffolding, put the “player” in control of play, encourage strategic collaboration, and make sure that the student not only receives immediate feedback for every action, but that their play is always guided by a well-understood purpose and expectation of the “rules.”  Academic buoyancy is something that teachers should always encourage in students, and this consists of composure, confidence, coordination, commitment, and control. With a mindset that fosters the development of these traits, the difficult aspects of learning are overcome and mastered as surely as the material itself.  Productive failure is the perspective that failure itself is a valuable teacher, and can enhance understanding and mastery more than success can. Teachers can model an optimal attitude to failure—i.e. that it is normal, manageable and indeed useful.  Good teachers should create a learning atmosphere free from judgment. This means disconnecting performance from the student’s self-worth or identity, so that failure and mistakes are not perceived as threatening or humiliating. When a teacher models nonjudgment, a student feels safe to explore, experiment and make purposeful mistakes on their learning journey.  Feedback is a vital part of the student environment. Good feedback is concrete, specific to the goal in question, timely, meaningful, relevant and understandable to the student, and comes with clear and realistic steps for next actions. It is not judgment, advice, praise or criticism without meaningful elaboration on the learning process itself.  Summary

For Pabrai, one of the secrets of successful investing is to avoid anything that’s too hard. He automatically passes on investments in countries such as Russia and Zimbabwe, given their contempt for shareholder rights. He avoids all start-ups and initial public offerings (IPOs), since he’s unlikely to find bargains in arenas dominated by sales hype and inflated expectations. He has never sold a stock short because the maximum upside is 100 percent (if the stock falls to zero), while the downside is unlimited (if the stock soars). “Why bet with those odds?” he asks. He also largely ignores the infinite complexity of macroeconomics, focusing instead on a handful of critical microfactors that are likely to drive a specific business. In short, simplicity rules.

How, then, can individuals reduce their vulnerability and bolster their resilience? Following Buffett’s lead, we should always keep enough cash in reserve so we’ll never be forced to sell stocks (or any other beleaguered asset) in a downturn.

And we should bypass businesses with weak balance sheets or a looming need for external funding, which is liable to disappear in times of distress.

Before reading, pre-read the chapter ahead, survey its structure, and generate your questions. After speed-reading each paragraph or page, pause, and take a moment to recall, creating visual markers to represent what you learned. Once you’ve finished the chapter, close the book and review those visual markers. And of course, revisit the books you’ve read with some form of spaced repetition. Unless you complete each of these steps—particularly the memory aspects—you will have no more success than I did before discovering this method.

During one experiment, psychologists noted archly that their participants’ ‘compulsion to know the answer was so great that they were willing to pay for the information, even though curiosity could have been sated for free after the session.’ In his paper ‘The Psychology of Curiosity’, Loewenstein breaks down four ways of involuntarily inducing curiosity in humans: (1) the ‘posing of a question or presentation of a puzzle’; (2) ‘exposure to a sequence of events with an anticipated but unknown resolution’; (3) ‘the violation of expectations that triggers a search for an explanation’; (4) knowledge of ‘possession of information by someone else’.

Psychologists measure personality across five domains, which can be useful for writers doing character work to know. Those high in extraversion are gregarious and assertive, seekers of attention and sensation. Being high in neuroticism means you’re anxious, self-conscious and prone to depression, anger and low self-esteem. Lots of openness makes for a curious soul, someone artistic, emotional and comfortable with novelty. High-agreeable people are modest, sympathetic and trusting while their disagreeable opposites have a competitive and aggressive bent. Conscientious people prefer order and discipline and value hard work, duty and hierarchy.

I like to run a lean business with low overheads and predictable income (a membership model run by a small team working from home).

So if you earn £60,000 a year, working a 100-hour week, you’re on £11.54 an hour, but if you draw £50,000 a year and work 20 hours a week, you’re taking home £48.08 an hour. (Of course, the more holidays you take and time you spend away from your business, the higher your actual hourly rate (AHR) goes). Working this actual hourly rate out was the key factor in my wife quitting her teaching job. She was on a good headline salary, but worked an extra 40 hours a week for free. When we calculated her AHR, she earned £8.50 an hour as a university graduate with two decades of experience. Discovering she could earn more per hour as an entry-level employee at McDonald’s

But if I market to the people who already have my customers’ trust, I open up a much higher leveraged channel. If I can turn a book club, accountant or business coach into a true fan, a recommendation from them carries far more weight than an advert from yours truly and I could sell dozens or even hundreds of books in one fell swoop.

Prospective clients end up choosing the wrong product or service, just because lots of people know them. Knowing someone is not the same as knowing, liking, and trusting them.

Lateral knowledge is knowledge that’s from a wholly unexpected direction, from a direction that’s not even understood as a direction until the knowledge forces itself upon one. Lateral truths point to the falseness of axioms and postulates underlying one’s existing system of getting at truth.
